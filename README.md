# Python-OOP-Tutorial
Object Oriented Programming combines data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object. Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. An analogy is that you can have variables of type int which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class.
